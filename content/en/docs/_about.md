# About Nanite Linux

Nanite is more than just another Linux distribution – it's a revolutionary platform that brings artificial intelligence directly to your desktop, making AI capabilities as accessible as opening a file or running a program.

## Our Vision

We believe that AI should be democratized and accessible to everyone, not locked behind proprietary cloud services or expensive APIs. Nanite makes this vision a reality by integrating powerful AI models directly into the operating system, ensuring your data stays private while giving you cutting-edge AI capabilities.

## The Nanite Philosophy

### Privacy-First Design
All AI processing happens locally on your machine by default. Your data never leaves your computer unless you explicitly choose to use cloud services.

### Open Source Foundation
Built on Debian Linux, Nanite embraces the open-source philosophy. The entire distribution is open source, allowing for community contributions and complete transparency.

### Developer-Centric
Designed by developers, for developers. Nanite includes everything you need for AI and machine learning development out of the box.

### Performance Optimized
Carefully tuned for optimal performance with AI workloads, whether you're running inference on large language models or training custom neural networks.

## Key Technologies

### Debian Base
Nanite is built on Debian's stable foundation, ensuring reliability and compatibility with the vast ecosystem of Linux software.

### Ollama Integration
Language models are managed through Ollama, providing easy access to models like Mistral, CodeLlama, and others.

### XFCE Desktop Environment
A lightweight yet powerful desktop environment that doesn't compete with AI workloads for system resources.
